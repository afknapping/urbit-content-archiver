The Urbit Operator Toolkit is a small CLI application that interacts with your ship externally and allows you to perform useful functionality as a ship operator. The first feature of the toolkit is the ability to export chat logs from any chat which your ship has joined. Further useful functionality/"tools" will be added over time as the [Rust Urbit HTTP API Crate](https://crates.io/crates/urbit-http-api) continues to be updated and have more functionality to expose here for end users.
